This site is a personal space for sharing my thoughts and work. It's a perpetual work in progress — I keep things minimal and update when I feel like it.

Built with Next.js and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS. Articles are written in MDX. Deployed on Vercel. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mrskiro/mrskiro.dev).
